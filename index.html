            <h2>What is Technical Coaching+ with Kapok?</h2>
            <p>We will work with you to discover your constraints, bottlenecks, and opportunity areas and then make an impact in those areas through coaching, experimentation and iteration.</p>
            
            <br>
            <h3>Learning</h3>
            <p>To help your business, we have to understand it. We're here to listen to you. We want to learn things like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What success means, global and local incentives, the goals</li>
                <li>Team structures, communication structures</li>
                <li>Industry nuances, ubiquitous language</li>
            </ul>
            
            <br>
            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p>We will work with you to identify what is constraining your business from reaching its goals and quantify so we can measure progress.</p>

            <br>
            <h3>Coaching</h3>
            <p>We will use our expertise and knowledge of your systems to coach your team to exploit your bottlenecks. Here are a few abstract examples of coaching items:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Problem: Infrequent error-prone feature releases that cause minor/major outages → Potential Coaching: We'll coach your developers on how to introduce quality assurance earlier in the development lifecycle</li>
                <li>Problem: There are frequent discrepancies between feature requests and what is delivered → Potential Coaching: We'll work with your team/developers on how to speak the same language as your operations counterparts and really understand the problem</li>
                <li>Problem: Teams are often fighting with each other for resources to accomplish their goals → Potential Coaching: We'll work with teams to establish unity of purpose and help them discover non-conflicting paths forward</li>
            </ul>
            
            <br>
            <h3>What We Are Not Doing?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Selling a framework or prescriptive solution. The only problems we'll be helping to solve will be yours.</li>
                <li>Replacing your staff. Think of us more as investing in the performance of your people.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Figuring Out Our Fit</h2>
            <p>Kapok is not a great fit for every software organization. We take on only a few clients and work with them very closely.</p>

            <br>
            <h3>Clients that are a Good Fit for Us:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You've found product-market fit and have a customer base.</li>
                <li>Something is going wrong.</li>
                <li style="margin-left:20px">Frequent unplanned work stopping you from working on what you want to work on.</li>
                <li style="margin-left:20px">Team is frequently working on weekends and unable to take breaks.</li>
                <li style="margin-left:20px">Organization is in crisis of some kind.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h3>Clients that are Not a Good Fit for Us:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Your products are not mature, and you're still searching for product-market fit.</li>
                <li>Your organization is stable, and things are going really well.</li>
            </ul>
