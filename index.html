            <h2>What is Technical Coaching+ with Kapok?</h2>
            <p>We will work with you to discover your constraints, bottlenecks, opportunity areas and then make impact in those areas through experimentation and iteration. To be able to do this, we first need to understand your business.</p>
            
            <br/>
            <h3>Learning</h3>
            <p>To help your business we have to understand your business. We're here to listen to you. We want to learn things like:</p>
            <p>    - What success means, global and local incentives, the goals </p>
            <p>    - Team structures, communication structures </p>
            <p>    - Industry nuances, ubiquitous language </p>
            
            <br/>
            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p>We will work with you to identify what is constraining your business from reaching it's goals.</p>

            <br/>
            <h3>Coaching</h3>
            <p>We will use our expertise and knowledge of your systems to coach your team to exploit your bottlenecks. Here are a few abstract examples of coaching items:</p>
            <p>    - Problem: Infrequent error/prone feature releases that cause minor/major outages -> Potential Coaching: We'll coach your developers on how to introduce quality assurance earlier in the development lifecycle </p>
            <p>    - Problem: There are frequent disrepencies between feature requests and what is delivered -> Potental Coaching: We'll work with your team/developers on how to speak the same language as your operations counterparts and really understand what they're asking for </p>
            <p>    - Problem: Teams are often fighting with each other for resources to accomplish their goals -> Potential Coaching: We'll work with teams to establish unity of purpose and show them there are no actual conflicts when striving towards the same goal </p>
            
            <br/>
            <h3>What are we not doing?</h3>
            <p>    - Selling a framework or prescriptive solution. The only problems we'll be helping solve will be yours. </p>
            <p>    - Replacing your staff. Think of us more as investing in the performance of your staff. </p>

            <h2>Figuring Our Fit</h2>
            <p>Kapok is not a great fit for every software organization. We take on only a few clients and work with them very closely.</p>

            <p>You've found product market fit and have a customer base.</p>
            <p>Something is going wrong.</p>
            <p>    - Frequent unplanned work stopping you from working on what you want to work on. </p>
            <p>    - Team is frequently working on the weekends and unable to take breaks </p>
            <p>    - Organization is in crisis of some kind </p>

            <br/>
            <h3>Clients that are not a good fit for us:</h3>
            <p>Your products are not mature and you're still searching for product makert fit.</p>
            <p>Your organization is stable and things are going really well</p>
