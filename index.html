            <h2>Technical Coaching+</h2>
            <p>We will work with you to discover your constraints, bottlenecks, and opportunity areas and then make an impact in those areas through coaching, experimentation and iteration.</p>
            
            <br>
            <h3>Learning</h3>
            <p>To help your business, we have to understand it. We're here to listen to you. We want to learn things like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What success means, global and local incentives, the goals</li>
                <li>Team structures, communication structures</li>
                <li>Industry nuances, ubiquitous language</li>
            </ul>
            
            <br>
            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p>We will work with you to identify what is constraining your business from reaching its goals and quantify so we can measure progress.</p>

            <br>
            <h3>Coaching</h3>
            <p>We will use our expertise and knowledge of your systems to coach your team to exploit your bottlenecks. Here are a few abstract examples of coaching items:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Problem: Infrequent error-prone feature releases that cause minor/major outages → Potential Coaching: We'll coach your developers on how to introduce quality assurance earlier in the development lifecycle</li>
                <li>Problem: There are frequent discrepancies between feature requests and what is delivered → Potential Coaching: We'll work with your team/developers on how to speak the same language as your operations counterparts and really understand the problem</li>
                <li>Problem: Teams are often fighting with each other for resources to accomplish their goals → Potential Coaching: We'll work with teams to establish unity of purpose and help them discover non-conflicting paths forward</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h3>Repeat</h3>
            <p>We'll continue to go through this cycle with your business and staff. Our goal is to make it so your business is not dependant on external coaching in the future and this process can be driven internally.</p>
            <br>
            <hr>

            <br>
            <h3>What We Are Not Doing?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Selling a framework or prescriptive solution. The only problems we'll be helping to solve will be yours.</li>
                <li>Replacing your staff. Think of us more as investing in the performance of your people.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Figuring Out Our Fit</h2>
            <p>Kapok is not a great fit for every software organization. We take on only a few clients and work with them very closely.</p>

            <br>
            <h3>Clients that are a Good Fit for Us:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You've found product-market fit and have a customer base.</li>
                <li>Something is going wrong.</li>
                <li style="margin-left:20px">Frequent unplanned work stopping you from working on what you want to work on.</li>
                <li style="margin-left:20px">Team is frequently working on weekends and unable to take breaks.</li>
                <li style="margin-left:20px">Organization is in crisis of some kind.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h3>Clients that are Not a Good Fit for Us:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Your products are not mature, and you're still searching for product-market fit.</li>
                <li>Your organization is stable, and things are going really well.</li>
